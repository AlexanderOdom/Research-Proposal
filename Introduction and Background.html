  <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>The topic I will be discussing is how accessible Portland is to cyclists, and how they affect the roads they ride on. I mainly want to look at road infrastructure and how it dictates interactions between drivers and cyclists; it’s important to understand so we can make roads easier to ride for both. Riding around Portland, it is immediately clear that the city was not made for bikes or cars. Several roads are narrow one ways with shared lanes between cyclists and motorized vehicles. A few main roads are large enough to carry both a bike lane, and antiparallel lanes for cars. These roads usually span the whole city but sometimes they turn into narrow shared roads again. To add to the difficulty of moving around the city, some roads are often blocked by ongoing construction or the unloading of a trailer which, most of the time, pushes both cyclists and cars into outer lanes. Lastly there are unavoidable rail lines that go throughout Portland and usually make normal turns for cyclists impossible due to the difficulty of crossing the lines when running parallel with the tracks. Too shallow of a turn and a cyclist's tire can slide within the groove of the track causing injury.</p>

 <h1>Background</h1>
  <p>The most of what I already know comes from rides that I have taken around certain areas of Portland. Most of which are down around the river and over the peoples bridge; it's the most accessible place for bikes to ride in the city. If there is a challenge sought by cyclists they could take Terwilliger blvd. out of the city, or attempt a ride into Portland heights or to the zoo. But for casual riders and commuters, there is little within the city that is fully accessible. In the pursuit for cleaner modes of transportation, many cities have also begun to incorporate bike accessible roads into their infrastructure (Buehler. 2011). Bike sharing is rapidly growing and could be beneficial in reducing the amount of personal vehicles on the road (Martin. 2014). With the study of 90 large cities (Buehler. 2011) and the focus on two specific cities like Washington D.C. and Minneapolis (Martin. 2014), it appears that cities are making a good change. But the question shouldn’t be whether or not they’re making that change, the question should be whether or not the infrastructure can truely support what is being done. I don’t believe places like Portland can support true bike accessibility. In other places, like Eugene Oregon, downtown is almost entirely bike specific on small roads, and larger streets carry a bike lane. If Portland is unable to support bikes, what alterations within the city's infrastructure would change this?</p>
