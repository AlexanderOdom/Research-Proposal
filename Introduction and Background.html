    <p>The most of what I already know comes from rides that I have taken around certain areas of Portland. Most of which are down around the river and over the peoples bridge; it's the most accessible place for bikes to ride in the city. If there is a challenge sought by cyclists they could take Terwilliger blvd. out of the city, or attempt a ride into Portland heights or to the zoo. But for casual riders and commuters, there is little within the city that is fully accessible. In the pursuit for cleaner modes of transportation, many cities have also begun to incorporate bike accessible roads into their infrastructure (Buehler. 2011). Bike sharing is rapidly growing and could be beneficial in reducing the amount of personal vehicles on the road (Martin. 2014). With the study of 90 large cities (Buehler. 2011) and the focus on two specific cities like Washington D.C. and Minneapolis (Martin. 2014), it appears that cities are making a good change. But the question shouldn’t be whether or not they’re making that change, the question should be whether or not the infrastructure can truely support what is being done. I don’t believe places like Portland can support true bike accessibility. In other places, like Eugene Oregon, downtown is almost entirely bike specific on small roads, and larger streets carry a bike lane. If Portland is unable to support bikes, what alterations within the city's infrastructure would change this?</p>
