  <h1>Rationale</h1>
   <p>The layout of a city is important to what is able to move through it easily and effectively. Neither cyclists or cars can move through Portland easily. A straightforward layout of roads helps navigation around the city, but Portland is filled with an obscene amount of one ways that are congested with parked cars and unloading trucks, Met and bus lanes that block turns, and some roads end in highway on ramps that also come off of, and are crossed by, one ways. It’s hard to determine whether the roads were made to fit the city, or the city to fit the roads. It is important to question what alterations to the city of Portland would make it more accessible to cyclists. Portland is not accessible due to choices made by the city to make it more accessible. Portland is made in such a way that increases the risk of cycling accidents. If I’m right, it would mean that in Portland there is a high amount of individuals who have experienced a crash within the city. If I am wrong, it would mean that a high amount of individuals have not experienced a crash within the city.</p>
