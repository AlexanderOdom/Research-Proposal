  <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The topic I will be discussing is how accessible Portland is to cyclists, and how they affect the roads they ride on. I mainly want to look at road infrastructure and how it dictates interactions between drivers and cyclists; it’s important to understand so we can make roads easier to ride for both.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The most of what I already know comes from rides that I have taken around certain areas of Portland. Most of which take me down around RLSB and over the peoples bridge; it's the most accessible place for bikes to ride in the city. Early last year I studied the Portland Plan, if i’m remembering correctly there is an entire section on bike accessibility. The issue is that studies like the Portland Plan don’t go in depth about the effect cyclists have on the road because of the city/ road infrastructure.</p>
    <p>How does the lack of a bike lane affect how a road is used? How does excessive amounts of road work change the way cars and bikes move throughout the city? Do the changes made during construction improve infrastructure or make it more difficult to get around the city? I believe all these questions are important to focus on and deserve their own discussion, each one is vital to answering the next. If I were to pick one it would be the second. Construction impacts Portland in major ways due to the city's layout, and affects both cars and cyclists. The majority of the time, cyclists lose their lane when construction starts so they are forced to use the rest of the road.</p>

    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <p>I will be exploring how excessive amounts of road work change the way cars and bikes move throughout the city. This relates to my primary question; construction has the greatest impact on how drivers and cyclists interact. Cyclists are pushed out into the road, this causes cars to slow down, construction also increases the risk of an accident occurring between the two vehicles because they’re sharing a road. I believe that by pushing cyclists out into a shared road it increases the risk of accidents. If I’m right it would mean that in areas of construction or shared roads there is a higher amount of accidents between cyclists and motorized vehicles than those with bike lanes. If I’m wrong there would be no change in the number of accidents (not necessarily lower) in these areas.</p>

    <h2>Method & Design</h2>
    <p>I would collect data through the use of participant surveys. This method is best for my topic due to the fact that I would be able to ask specific questions to a multitude of people in a short amount of time. Also, the answers could be multiple choice allowing for more control over the outcome. The survey would be targeted mostly towards cyclists of all ages and bike types; it’s important to note the differences between how age groups are treated on the road, as well as how different bikes are seen. I would exclude those who ride mainly on bike paths or sidewalks (<strong>which is illegal</strong>) because they don’t affect the road.</p>
    <p>Some of the things I would test for is what age group people belong to, what kind of bike they own, whether or not they ride on the road, sidewalk, or strictly bike paths, the speed at which they ride, possibly a short answer question about the roads they have ridden on and how construction affects their riding. Additional stimulating questions would apply to these, including if cars have ever gotten impatient with their speed, if they have intentionally made their way out of Portland to ride, or if the bike paths feel crowded or limiting. These additional questions would help support my hypothesis because they go more in depth about the cyclists personal experiences on the roads of Portland.</p>
    <p>My hypothesis could be unsupported by my research due to the fact that my experience might be completely different from those who grew up in and around Portland. I grew up in Eugene, I’ve ridden the trails and roads so to me Portland lacks the variety I had at home. To control the survey, I would only allow for it to be taken once and depending on the answers someone responded with, control over how far they get in the survey. Control over the survey in this way means control over people's answers and what they can answer. An overall negative census in the survey could point towards Portland being a poor place to ride, which would support my hypothesis, but an overall positive census in the survey could point towards Portland being a great place to ride, which wouldn’t support my hypothesis. The overall design of this survey would hopefully prevent any sceau due to improper answering of the survey.</p>
