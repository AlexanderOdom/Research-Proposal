   <h1>Research Proposal</h1>
 <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>The topic I will be discussing is how accessible Portland is to cyclists, and how they affect the roads they ride on. I mainly want to look at road infrastructure and how it dictates interactions between drivers and cyclists; itâ€™s important to understand so we can make roads easier to ride for both. Riding around Portland, it is immediately clear that the city was not made for bikes or cars. Several roads are narrow one ways with shared lanes between cyclists and motorized vehicles. A few main roads are large enough to carry both a bike lane, and antiparallel lanes for cars. These roads usually span the whole city but sometimes they turn into narrow shared roads again. To add to the difficulty of moving around the city, some roads are often blocked by ongoing construction or the unloading of a trailer which, most of the time, pushes both cyclists and cars into outer lanes. Lastly there are unavoidable rail lines that go throughout Portland and usually make normal turns for cyclists impossible due to the difficulty of crossing the lines when running parallel with the tracks. Too shallow of a turn and a cyclist's tire can slide within the groove of the track causing injury.</p>
