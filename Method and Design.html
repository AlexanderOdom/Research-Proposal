   <h1>Method and Design</h1>
    <p>I would collect data through the use of participant surveys. This method is best for my topic due to the fact that I would be able to ask specific questions to a multitude of people in a short amount of time. Also, the answers could be multiple choice allowing for more control over the outcome. The survey would be targeted mostly towards cyclists of all ages and bike types; it’s important to note the differences between how age groups are treated on the road, as well as how different bikes are seen. Some of the things I would test for is what age group people belong to, what kind of bike they own, whether or not they ride on the road, sidewalk, or strictly bike paths, the speed at which they ride, possibly a short answer question about the roads they have ridden on and how Portlands infrastructure affects their riding. Additional stimulating questions would apply to these, including if cars have ever gotten impatient with their speed, if they have intentionally made their way out of Portland to ride, or if the bike paths feel crowded or limiting. These additional questions would help support my hypothesis because they go more in depth about the cyclists personal experiences on the roads of Portland.</p>
    <p>My hypothesis could be unsupported by my research due to the fact that my experience might be completely different from those who grew up in and around Portland. I grew up in Eugene, I’ve ridden the trails and roads so to me Portland lacks the variety and accessibility I had at home. To control the survey, I will only allow for it to be taken once and depending on the answers someone responded with, control over how far they get in the survey. An overall negative census in the survey could point towards Portland being a poor place to ride, which would support my hypothesis, but an overall positive census in the survey could point towards Portland being a great place to ride, which wouldn’t support my hypothesis. The overall design of this survey would hopefully prevent any sceau.</p>
